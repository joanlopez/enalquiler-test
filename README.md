# Enalquiler Engineering Technical Test

### PROBLEM APPROACH 

- OOP approach
- PHP7 compatible (but not exploited)
- Unit & Integration testing (with PHPUnit)

### INSTRUCTIONS

> git clone

> cd enalquiler-test

> php composer.phar install
 
> vendor\bin\phpunit --testsuite all

### SOLUTION

The last Plateau test present in the integration tests suite was created 
with the idea of providing a simple method to check the expected behaviour
of the implementation.
